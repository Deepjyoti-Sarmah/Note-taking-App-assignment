# Note-taking App with Rich Text and Drawing Capabilities

This Note-taking App is a 4-day hackathon project, created to combine multiple open-source JavaScript libraries for a seamless and innovative note-taking experience.
Objective

The app integrates two primary libraries:
- Quill.js for rich text editing
- tldraw for drawing and diagramming

Together, these provide a powerful platform where users can create and organize text notes alongside visual diagrams. This combination enhances note-taking by supporting diverse content types in a single, intuitive interface.

## Features

- Rich Text Editor: Users can format text, add headers, bullet points, links, images, and more, using Quill.js.
- Drawing Board: Embedded drawing tools allow the addition of diagrams or freeform sketches via tldraw.
- Seamless Interface: Built with React, TailwindCSS, and sadcnui to ensure a clean, modern, and responsive user experience.
- Data Persistence: Save and retrieve notes with text and drawings, enhancing productivity.

## Libraries Used

- Quill.js: Provides customizable and extensible text editing.
- tldraw: Offers a canvas-based drawing interface to capture sketches or diagrams.
- React (v18) with TypeScript: Ensures type safety and a robust, component-based architecture.
- TailwindCSS & sadcnui: For a responsive, minimalistic design.

## Plan for Future Enhancements

If additional time were available, I would extend the applicationâ€™s functionality with the following features:

- Database Integration: Add a PostgreSQL database to support user accounts and note storage for secure data management.
- Folder Structure: Implement a folder-based organization to help users categorize and organize notes efficiently.
- PWA Support: Develop the app as a Progressive Web Application (PWA) so users can install it on their desktops and use it offline.

## Getting Started

- Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/Deepjyoti-Sarmah/Note-taking-App-assignment`
- Install dependencies: `npm install`
- Run the app: `npm run dev`
